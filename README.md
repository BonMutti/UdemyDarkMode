# UdemyDarkMode

A simple browser extension which changes some colors on the course pages of Udemy classes to be dark-mode friendly.
Expected future updates are to extend dark mode to be site-wide rather than only on course pages.

- Open the Chrome Extensions tab (chrome://extensions/).
- In the upper right-hand corner, toggle "Developer Mode" on.
- In the upper left-hand corner click "Load Unpacked".
- Choose the extension file that you downloaded and then hit "Select Folder".
- Now it should be installed, make sure it is toggled on!
