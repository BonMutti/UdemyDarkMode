# UdemyDarkMode

A simple browser extension which changes some colors on the course pages of Udemy classes to be dark-mode friendly.
Expected future updates are to extend dark-mode to be site-wide rather than only on course pages.

Open Chrome Developer Tools. In the upper right-hand corner, toggle "Developer Mode" on. In the upper left-hand corner click "Load Unpacked". Click on the downloaded folder and then "Select Folder". Now it should be installed, make sure it is toggled on!
